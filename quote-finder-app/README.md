# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Port is changed intentionally to 8001 so that it does not disrupt any app running in 3000\
Open [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001) to view it in your browser.

The solution is split into two components - the quote component to perform search and quotedetails to display the results.
I have used quoteData.Json file to Mimic the data coming from API. More quotes can be added
Kindly reach out to me in case the solution is not running in your machine.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
